//Add at least two classes to your program—one class for each type of item—or media type—that can be added to your media library.
//Define each class using the class keyword within its own C# code file.
//Use "Treehouse.MediaLibrary" for the namespace.
//Add at least two public fields to each media type class that you added in step #1.
//Each field definition should include an access modifier, a data type, and a name.

//2nd Challenge
//In the Program.cs file 'Main()' method, use the 'new' keyword to create at least one instance of each of your media type classes.
//For each of the objects that you create, set each field to an appropriate value.

//3rd Challenge
//Add a constructor to each of your media type classes.
//Define a constructor parameter for each of the world's type's required fields and use those parameter values to initialize its fields.
//Update the Program.cs file 'Main()' method in order for your program to successfully complete.

//Practice 2
//1st Challenge) Add a "GetDisplayText()" method to your selected media type ckass.  This method should return a string containing the 
//display text for the media type item.
//Example: The "GetDisplayText()" method for an Album class would return the text "Ablum: Yellow Submarine by The Beatles" if the "Title" 
//field was set to "Yellow Submarine" and the "Artist" field was set to "The Beatles".

//Practice Inheritance
//    Exercise 1
//Add a MediaType base class to your program.

//Add a public field named Title of type string.
//Add a constructor to the MediaType class.
//Define a parameter named title of type string.
//Initialize the Title field using the title parameter.
//Update your existing media type classes to inherit from the MediaType base class.

//Call the base class' constructor from each of the media type subclasses.
//Review your media type subclasses and remove any Title field definitions from those classes.

//Remove any constructor initialization code related to the removed Title fields.
