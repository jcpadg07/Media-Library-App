//Add at least two classes to your program—one class for each type of item—or media type—that can be added to your media library.
//Define each class using the class keyword within its own C# code file.
//Use "Treehouse.MediaLibrary" for the namespace.
//Add at least two public fields to each media type class that you added in step #1.
//Each field definition should include an access modifier, a data type, and a name.

//2nd Challenge
//In the Program.cs file 'Main()' method, use the 'new' keyword to create at least one instance of each of your media type classes.
//For each of the objects that you create, set each field to an appropriate value.

//3rd Challenge
//Add a constructor to each of your media type classes.
//Define a constructor parameter for each of the world's type's required fields and use those parameter values to initialize its fields.
//Update the Program.cs file 'Main()' method in order for your program to successfully complete.
